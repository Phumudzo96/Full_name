# Full_name

This program will be used to validate that a user inputs at least two names
when asked to enter their full name.

Ask the user to input their full name.

Do some validation to check that the user has entered a full name. Give an
appropriate error message if they haven’t. One of the following messages
should be displayed based on the user’s input:

o “You haven’t entered anything. Please enter your full name.”

o “You have entered less than 4 characters. Please make sure that you have entered your name and surname.”

o “You have entered more than 25 characters. Please make sure that you have only entered your full name.”

o “Thank you for entering your name.”
